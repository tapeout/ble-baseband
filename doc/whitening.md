# Whitening
A whitening module is used to prevent long sequences of zeros or ones. It is performed similar to a CRC despite some subtle difference. According to the Bluetooth spec, whitening is applied to PDU and CRC fields and is performed after CRC in the packet assembler, and dewhitening is applied similarly before CRC in the packet disassembler.

Whitening and de-whitening is achieved using a 7-bit Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). The shift register is initialized in the following manner:
* Position 0 is set to 1
* Positions 1 to 6 is set to the channel index of the transmitting/receiving channel, with the most significant bit set to position 1 and the least significant bit set to position 6. In this case, the channel index is 0x25, so the shift register is initialized to 1100101.

There is a subtle but important difference in the LFSR of whitening/dewhitening and CRC: for whitening, the input bit is not fed into the register. Instead, it is XORed with the bit at position 6 at every clock cycle to generate the output bit. The rest is similar: at every clock cycle the LFSR shifts the existing bits to the right and perform XOR operation on the tap bits.

 ## Input and Output Ports
 ```
 class Whitening extends Module {
    val io = IO(new Bundle {
        val operand  = Flipped(DecoupledIO(UInt(1.W)))
        val result   = Decoupled(UInt(1.W))
        val seed     = Input(UInt(7.W))
        val init     = Input(Bool())       
  })
}
 ```
 Like a CRC module, a whitening has three inputs and one output. `init` is a 1-bit input sent by the packet assembler as the signal of the beginning of the sequence. `seed` is a 7-bit input that CRC module needs to load to the corresponding registers. `operand` is a 1-bit input for bits to perform certain operations. `result` is a 1-bit output produced by whitening and taken by the packet assembler. 

## Test
A scala unit test is provided for the whitening module. To perform the unit test, type `sbt` in the root directory. After that, type `testOnly Whitening_test.WhiteningTester` in the sbt terminal.

Similar to the CRC module, the whitening module is also used extensively in the packet assmebler/packet disassembler, and can be tested against the software golden model in the overall test.
