# CRC
The cyclic redundency check is used for error detection and error correction according to the 24-bit CRC sequence in a BLE packet (BLE Spec Vol 6, Part B, Section 3.1.1). The CRC sequence is generated according to PDU when data is transmitted, and is checked by the packet disassembler. If the CRC sequence is correct, then the data is processed. Otherwise, the data is rejected.

According to Bluetooth Spec v.05, "for every Data Channel PDU, the shift register shall be preset with the CRC initialization value set for the Link Layer connection and communicated in the `CONNECT_IND` PDU. For the `AUX_SYNC_IND` PDU and its subordinate set, the shift register shall be preset with the CRCInit value set in the SyncInfo field (see Section 2.3.4.6) contained in the `AUX_ADV_IND` PDU that describes the periodic advertising. For all other Advertising Channel PDUs, the shift register shall be preset with 0x555555." The last case applies to this projct. The diagram below illustrates how the LFSR is initialized.

When initializing, position 0 of the LFSR is set as the least significant bit, and position 23 of the LFSR is the most significant bit. In the packet assembler and packet disassembler, starting from the PDU header, the LFSR takes in one input bit per clock cycle, shift the existing bits to the right, and perform xor logic operation on some of the bits (denoted as taps) as shown above.

One thing to note is that the CRC is transmitted most significant bit first (from position 23 to position 0), which is different from other parts of the BLE packet.
 
 ## Input and Output Ports
 ```
class Serial_CRC extends Module {
    val io      = IO(new Bundle {
      val operand  = Flipped(Decoupled(UInt(1.W)))
      val result   = Decoupled(UInt(24.W))
      val seed       = Input(UInt(24.W))
      val init       = Input(Bool())        
  })
}
 ```
A CRC module has three inputs and one output. `init` is a 1-bit input sent by the packet assembler as the signal of the beginning of the sequence. `seed` is a 24-bit input that CRC module needs to load to the corresponding registers. `operand` is a 1-bit input for bits to perform certain operations. `result` is a 24-bit output produced by CRC and taken by the packet assembler.  

## Test

A simple scala test is provided for the crc module. To perform the unit test, type `sbt` in the root directory. After that, type `testOnly CRC_test.Serial_CRCTester` in the sbt terminal.

CRC also plays an important role in the top level test, and the CRC value of BLE packets can be compared to the software golden model after the top level test of [PAChain](https://github.com/ucberkeley-ee290c/fa18-ble/tree/master/doc/pa_chain.md) is completed.
